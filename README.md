SpaceDash is an app that provides information on all the present, past, and future **launches and vehicles of SpaceX**. The SpaceDash app also includes news and updates regarding all vehicles and missions.

The app is currently in the second stage of development and several new features are being scoped/built. These features include an AR view of various vehicles of SpaceX and event updates from even more Space Agencies!

The project uses test-drive agile development processes, where requirements are turned into test cases, and code is improved upon.¬†
